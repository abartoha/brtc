# brtc
## _the most uncreative name, ever_

A lightweight brightness control GUI tool written in python(tcl/tkinter), for those who don't want to scourge the system settings just to find that pesky brightness control or tap the monitor buttons into fragility.


I made it to save my eyes from burning in the night, and from being blinded by the sun in daytime, whle not touching the fragile monitor buttons at all or going to the settings (_I hate settings!_)
It can be used by both Windows and Linux users (not tested on Linux, please let me know)


# Recommended way of using it:

### Windows:
- Download the file from `exe_file` folder of the repo
- Copy the .exe to C:/Windows
- Then, Right Click on the file, Select `Properties`
- Choose the `Compatibility` tab and tick the `Run as Administrator` box
- Press `Win+R` to bring up RUN
- Type the tool name, nevertheless, `brtc`, and press enter
- Accept the prompt, scroll and set your brightness
- If oyu don't set Administrator, the system will prompt `Failed to Run Script`

### Linux:
- Linux users should be apt enough to do it by themselves
- Ok, maybe a hint? https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/425394/how-can-i-get-a-binary-from-a-py-file


## Features
- Just changing the brightness

> Work Smart, Live Lazy, But NEVER STOP LEARNING

This program uses the `screen_brightness_control` library, installed using `pip3 install screen_brightness_control`

I won't accept any contribution because I won't be available for a while. You an just copy the code and fiddle it for yourself.
